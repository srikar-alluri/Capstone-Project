Airline Pricing Dynamics Analysis Project

## Overview
During our capstone project, our team of five dynamic students collaborated on a compelling assignment for our client, QL2. The primary objective was to unravel intricate correlations in pricing dynamics among competitor and partner airlines across three distinct markets.

## Project Objective
Our focus was not just on data analysis but on creating actionable insights for QL2 based on their requirements. We developed a sophisticated inflection point detection mechanism designed to identify shifts in price trends and volatility among competitor airlines within specific markets. This innovative approach went beyond conventional data analysis, providing a valuable tool for airlines to discern the pricing strategies of their competitors.

## Key Features
Inflection Point Detection: Our system adeptly detects inflection points, signaling crucial moments when price trends and volatility undergo significant changes. This feature empowers airlines to make informed decisions in real-time.
Market-Centric Focus on Regional Dynamics: Our project specifically tailored its analysis to deliver market-centric insights for each region. This approach enables airlines to navigate the complexities of pricing dynamics in real-time, considering the unique factors influencing each market

## Feedback from client
One of the project highlights was the positive feedback from QL2, commending our adept handling of inherent data challenges. The client particularly appreciated our focus on pricing volatility as a key metric, recognizing its pivotal role in gaining actionable insights.

## Impact

Our mechanism not only honed our technical skills but also showcased our ability to innovate and deliver tangible solutions in a real-world, client-driven scenario. By focusing on pricing volatility, we provided QL2 with a tool that allows airlines to make strategic decisions on pricing strategies, ultimately contributing to their competitiveness in the market.

## Conclusion

This project not only advanced our technical expertise but also exemplified our commitment to addressing client challenges and delivering practical, innovative solutions. The collaborative effort resulted in a powerful tool that empowers airlines to navigate the ever-changing landscape of pricing dynamics with confidence.
